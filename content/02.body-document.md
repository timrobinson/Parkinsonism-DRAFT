## Introduction
The history of Parkinsonism began in 1817, when James Parkinson published An Essay on the Shaking Palsy, describing the characteristic motor symptoms of the condition that would later bear his name. Several decades later, Jean-Martin Charcot refined Parkinson’s observations, distinguishing the disease from other movement disorders and formally naming it Maladie de Parkinson. Charcot also noted degeneration of the substantia nigra, an insight later validated as a central pathological feature. Around 1900, Dejerine and Thomas described a distinct degenerative disorder now recognized as Multiple System Atrophy (MSA). Although its pathology differs from Parkinson’s Disease, MSA shares overlapping motor symptoms and is often confused with PD in clinical settings—a confusion made more understandable by the later discovery that both diseases involve toxic aggregates of misfolded alpha-synuclein. In 1912, Friedrich Lewy identified intraneuronal inclusions—later called Lewy bodies—marking the first visible pathological hallmark of PD, though their significance would remain unclear for decades.

The mid-20th century brought a major breakthrough when Arvid Carlsson demonstrated the essential role of the neurotransmitter dopamine in motor control and its abundance in the basal ganglia, laying the groundwork for understanding its depletion in Parkinson’s Disease (PD). This discovery led to dopamine-replacement therapy, culminating in the widespread use—and eventual FDA approval in 1975—of carbidopa/levodopa, which remains the cornerstone of PD treatment and is also the mainstay therapy for Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), despite its typically limited and short-lived benefits. In the 1980s, an unexpected insight came when individuals exposed to heroin laced with the synthetic drug MPTP developed rapid-onset parkinsonism. The compound’s inhibition of mitochondrial Complex I exposed the particular vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons to environmental toxins, marking a pivotal shift away from symptomatic treatments toward mechanistic studies focused on the cellular underpinnings of PD. Subsequent investigations uncovered key roles for mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and impaired protein clearance. In the 1990s, mutations in the SNCA gene, which encodes the alpha-synuclein protein, confirmed it as a causative factor in familial PD, and misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates were identified as the major component of Lewy bodies, cementing the protein’s central role in both inherited and sporadic forms of the disease.

Building on this mechanistic shift, Heiko Braak proposed in 2002 and 2003 that Parkinson’s Disease (PD) may originate outside the brain, with misfolded alpha-synuclein initially appearing in the enteric nervous system or olfactory bulb and then spreading in a prion-like fashion to the central nervous system (CNS). Although originally developed to describe PD, similar peripheral origins have been explored for Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), particularly given its early autonomic symptoms—such as constipation, urinary dysfunction, and orthostatic hypotension—and the detection of alpha-synuclein pathology in the peripheral nervous system. More recently, Filip Scheperjans and others have expanded this line of inquiry by implicating the gut microbiota in triggering the chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation that may drive early alpha-synuclein misfolding. These findings have reframed Parkinson’s research, and increasingly MSA research as well, shifting focus from late-stage neurodegeneration to the search for prodromal biomarkers and early therapeutic intervention.

All of these scientific developments—from Lewy’s discovery to Braak’s hypothesis and the rise of microbiome research—have expanded our understanding of Parkinsonism. Yet despite this progress, the clinical diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) remains largely reliant on neurologists' evaluation of motor symptoms—such as tremor, rigidity, balance, and coordination—which only manifest well after disease onset. Moreover, these symptoms overlap considerably between PD and MSA, making accurate differentiation difficult in early stages. While several promising biomarkers are under investigation, none are currently used as a front-line diagnostic tool. The closest example, a synuclein-positive skin biopsy, is typically reserved for confirmatory use after clinical suspicion has already been established. This gap underscores the need for sensitive, disease-specific biomarkers capable of identifying Parkinsonism early—ideally in its prodromal phase—when therapeutic intervention may be most effective.

## Peripheral Gateways to Pathogenesis

Peripheral structures like the intestinal lining and olfactory epithelium—first proposed as sites of disease initiation in Braak’s staging framework—have emerged as potential gateways for the development of PD and MSA, offering early access points through which environmental triggers may influence disease onset and progression. Of these, the intestinal lining has received the most sustained attention, particularly as a site where breaches in the epithelial barrier may allow microbial products or toxins to interact directly with neurons, glia, and immune cells. Misfolded α-synuclein originating in this environment may then propagate to the central nervous system via the vagus nerve. While Braak’s hypothesis initially emphasized anatomical spread, subsequent research has expanded its scope, implicating the gut microbiota and intestinal immune signaling in both initiating and sustaining the chronic inflammation that drives early protein misfolding. These findings have reframed the intestinal mucosa as a dynamic interface—one where microbial, immune, and neuronal signals converge to shape vulnerability or resilience.

### Microbiome and the Intestinal Lining

In the context of dysbiosis, different microbial populations may drive distinct but convergent inflammatory pathways in Parkinsonism. In PD, dysbiosis is typically characterized within the gut by an overrepresentation of gram-negative bacteria, whose outer membranes contain lipopolysaccharide (LPS)—a potent immune stimulator recognized by Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) on glial and immune cells. In contrast, MSA is more often associated with gut gram-positive dysbiosis, in which peptidoglycans (PGNs)—major components of the gram-positive cell wall—serve as the primary immunogenic signal. These peptidoglycans, particularly through fragments such as muramyl dipeptide (MDP), are detected by the intracellular pattern recognition receptor Nucleotide-binding Oligomerization Domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2), which is expressed on innate immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. Although LPS and PGNs activate distinct receptors (TLR4 vs. NOD2), both initiate downstream pro-inflammatory signaling cascades, converging mechanistically through chronic inflammation—a common hallmark of most neurodegenerative disease progression, including PD and MSA.

<center>ADD TABLE OF DYSBIOSIS FOR BOTH PD AND MSA</center>

This distinction underscores a fundamental difference in how dysbiosis may contribute to disease pathogenesis. While gram-negative bacterial products like LPS typically require a leaky gut to access host immune receptors at the cell surface, gram-positive bacteria may bypass this barrier by releasing extracellular vesicles (EVs). These EVs can be endocytosed by immune cells, delivering immunogenic peptidoglycan fragments such as muramyl dipeptide (MDP) directly into the cytosol, where they activate NOD2 and initiate inflammatory signaling.

The intestinal lining forms a complex, multilayered barrier that regulates the interface between the gut microbiota and host tissues. At its outermost surface—and directly adjacent to the gut microbiome—lies a single layer of epithelial cells joined by tight junction proteins, which together constitute the first physical and immunological barrier to microbial intrusion. In a healthy gut, this epithelial layer prevents bacterial products like LPS from entering deeper tissue compartments; however, MDP may bypass this barrier when delivered intracellularly via bacterial extracellular vesicles (EVs). However, when this barrier is compromised—a condition often referred to as “leaky gut”—microbial fragments from both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria can cross the epithelium and access the underlying lamina propria. This connective tissue layer hosts a rich network of immune cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells, as well as enteric glial cells that support local neuronal populations. It is within the lamina propria that much of the innate immune response is initiated, particularly through pattern recognition receptors like TLR4—previously activated by LPS—and NOD2, which detects bacterial peptidoglycans. As such, the integrity of the intestinal epithelium plays a central role in determining whether microbial signals are safely contained or become the spark for a sustained inflammatory response.

Enteric neurons reside within the gut wall in close proximity to immune and glial cells, forming a dense network governing gastrointestinal motility, secretion, and immune surveillance. Unlike dopaminergic neurons in the peripheral or central nervous systems, dopaminergic neurons in the enteric nervous system are unmyelinated, leaving the axonal membrane continuously exposed to the extracellular environment and rendering them more vulnerable to inflammatory damage. Their anatomical position—embedded within the lamina propria and submucosal plexus—places them in direct communication with both the gut epithelium and resident immune cells. This intimate spatial relationship makes enteric neurons among the first neuronal populations exposed to microbial products and other toxins. Although unmyelination is a common feature of enteric neurons, the selective vulnerability of dopaminergic populations likely reflects additional factors—such as their metabolic burden and reliance on α-synuclein—a topic explored further in a later section. This combination of environmental exposure and structural vulnerability positions enteric neurons as early targets in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies.

Enteric glial cells (EGCs) are multifunctional support cells that help regulate gut neuroimmune interactions. In a healthy gut, these cells help maintain neuronal function, regulate synaptic activity, and support epithelial barrier integrity. However, enteric glia, akin to immune cells, also have innate immune capabilities: they use pattern recognition receptors, including members of the Toll-Like Receptor family, to detect microbial products such as LPS and respond by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. Under conditions of chronic exposure to microbial stressors or persistent dysbiosis, these cells can adopt an active state that amplifies local inflammation and contributes to neuronal dysfunction. As such, EGCs sit at the intersection of microbial sensing, immune signaling, and neuronal support—poised to either protect or endanger dopaminergic neurons depending on the context of gut health. Together, these properties enable enteric glial cells to mediate early immune-neuronal interactions that contribute to the onset and progression of PD and MSA.

In addition to classical immune receptors like TLR4 and NOD2, emerging research highlights the role of neurotransmitter receptors—expressed on neurons, glial cells, and immune cells—in shaping the intensity and persistence of inflammation. Among these, the serotonin receptor 5-HT2A is of particular interest. It is expressed widely in the gastrointestinal tract, including on enteric glia and mucosal immune cells, and has been shown in some models to amplify cytokine production in response to microbial stressors. Other modulatory receptors, such as α7 nicotinic acetylcholine and purinergic receptors, may also contribute to this immunological tuning. This convergence of neurotransmission, microbial sensing, and immune regulation creates a self-reinforcing environment in which early signals from dysbiosis may be prolonged through receptor-mediated inflammatory feedback loops. This receptor-mediated feedback may represent a key mechanism by which inflammation persists beyond the initial microbial trigger.

Tryptophan metabolism provides an additional regulatory axis linking microbial imbalance, immune activation, and neurotransmitter availability. Under normal conditions, tryptophan serves as a precursor for serotonin synthesis in the gut. However, during systemic inflammation, homeostasis is perturbed, further biasing tryptophan metabolism toward the kynurenine pathway. This shift yields neuroactive metabolites that can modulate glial cell behavior, increase oxidative stress, and potentially promote alpha-synuclein misfolding. The loss of serotonin, combined with the rise of kynurenine-derived compounds, may further dysregulate the enteric environment, compounding neuronal vulnerability and inflammatory persistence. By altering the availability and metabolic fate of tryptophan, chronic inflammation not only reshapes neurotransmitter signaling but also deepens the pathological loop central to PD and MSA.

<center>ADD GRAPHIC OF TRYPTOPHAN PATHWAY</center>

While dysbiosis promotes inflammation through LPS, PGNs, and microbial vesicles, a healthy gut microbiota performs critical anti-inflammatory functions. One major class of protective metabolites is the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly butyrate, propionate, and acetate, which are produced through the fermentation of dietary fiber by gram-positive anaerobes. SCFAs enhance epithelial barrier integrity, support tight junction formation, and promote the development of regulatory T cells (Tregs) that help suppress immune overactivation. Butyrate, in particular, has been shown to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine production. In the context of PD and MSA, a loss of SCFA-producing bacteria has been observed, resulting in diminished immune tolerance, impaired barrier maintenance, and a permissive environment for sustained inflammation. This suggests that the shift in microbiota composition not only introduces pro-inflammatory signals but also removes essential counter-regulatory mechanisms.

Although this section focuses on the gut microbiome, it is important to note that other microbial ecosystems within the digestive tract—particularly the oral microbiome—may also contribute to systemic and neurological inflammation. Recent studies have identified associations between oral dysbiosis, periodontal disease, and neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease. However, microbial patterns in the oral cavity differ substantially from those in the gut. For example, while PD-associated dysbiosis in the colon often involves an overrepresentation of gram-negative bacteria and loss of SCFA-producing gram-positive species, these trends may not hold true in the oral environment. The oral microbiome is shaped by distinct environmental factors, immune interfaces, and microbial dynamics—including biofilm formation and epithelial invasion—making it a separate, though potentially convergent, source of inflammatory stimuli. For the purposes of this section, our discussion is restricted to the gut microbiome, with the oral biome reserved for future consideration or complementary investigation.

Early identification of chronic gut-derived inflammation—prior to the onset of overt motor symptoms—may present a critical window for therapeutic intervention. Measuring biomarkers associated with PD and MSA during this early prodromal stage opens the door to novel treatment strategies that address the disease before it becomes clinically entrenched. Central to this is the tipping point between neuroplasticity and neurodegeneration: as degeneration begins to outpace the brain's adaptive capacity, therapeutic windows narrow. A two-pronged strategy may help shift this balance. The first arm would target inflammatory potentiators such as the serotonin receptor 5-HT2A, using agonists in the R-DOI family or compounds with psychotropic or psychedelic properties to modulate receptor activity and attenuate cytokine amplification. The second would aim to restore metabolic balance, including interventions that reduce the accumulation of kynurenine-derived neurotoxic metabolites or promote serotonin availability. Enhancing neuroplasticity through lifestyle interventions—such as aerobic exercise, cognitive stimulation, and dietary modification—as well as emerging pharmacological therapies that promote neuronal resilience, may further strengthen the brain’s ability to resist degeneration. Together, these approaches may delay or prevent the neurodegenerative cascade that characterizes later-stage PD and MSA, offering a rationale for developing early detection strategies that shift intervention further upstream in the disease course.

________________________________

Mounting evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s Disease (PD) may begin in the Enteric Nervous System (ENS), progress through the autonomic branches of the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS), and ascend via a neural bridge—most notably, the vagus nerve—into the Central Nervous System (CNS). While this ENS-to-CNS progression is well supported in PD, similar pathways are being explored in Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), especially in cases where early autonomic symptoms and peripheral alpha-synuclein pathology are evident. Understanding the structural anatomy of these three interconnected systems is therefore critical to realizing how synucleinopathies may develop and spread through the body. A key to this understanding lies in comparing dopaminergic neurons as they appear in each of these environments: the Enteric Nervous System (ENS), the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS), and the Central Nervous System (CNS). These comparisons not only illustrate structural distinctions but also highlight how each system is uniquely affected in diseases like PD and MSA.

To visually anchor this comparison, we present a labeled illustration of representative neurons from each system. This drawing forms the centerpiece of this section and includes bullet points beneath each neuron to highlight their key structural and functional characteristics. These visual summaries also reinforce each system's relevance to synucleinopathies like PD and MSA.

<ins>Enteric Nervous System (ENS) Neuron</ins>

Although the ENS is technically a subdivision of the autonomic branch of the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS), its extensive autonomy and structural specialization justify its separate discussion here.
The ENS resides in the walls of the gastrointestinal tract, primarily within the myenteric and submucosal plexuses. These plexuses are dense, highly branched networks of unmyelinated neurons and enteric glial cells. Rather than transmitting long-range signals, these neurons coordinate complex, localized reflexes to control gut motility, secretion, and blood flow. The unmyelinated nature of ENS neurons facilitates tight packing and high-density connectivity, which is critical for fine-tuned digestive control.

Importantly, research suggests that alpha-synuclein pathology may begin in this region, with misfolded protein appearing in the enteric plexus before spreading via autonomic pathways to the CNS. This supports Braak's hypothesis that synucleinopathies such as PD and possibly MSA may originate in the gut.

<ins>Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) Neuron</ins>

PNS neurons bridge the gap between the CNS and the digestive tract and other visceral organs. They are frequently myelinated by Schwann cells, each of which wraps a single axonal segment. This design supports rapid conduction of autonomic signals critical for regulating functions like blood pressure and digestion. In the context of PD and MSA, the PNS is a useful diagnostic window: alpha-synuclein pathology can be detected in skin and autonomic nerves even in the prodromal phase of disease.

A notable distinction between PD and MSA lies in the extent of autonomic dysfunction seen in the PNS. MSA often presents with earlier and more severe autonomic symptoms—such as orthostatic hypotension, urinary incontinence, and erectile dysfunction—compared to PD. This greater impact on autonomic systems contributes directly to the term "multiple system atrophy," reflecting degeneration that extends beyond the motor system.

<ins>Central Nervous System (CNS) Neuron</ins>

CNS neurons reside within the brain and spinal cord and play integrative roles in everything from motor control to higher cognitive function. They are myelinated by oligodendrocytes, which can extend processes to multiple axons. Uniquely, a single oligodendrocyte can myelinate axons from multiple types of neurons—such as dopaminergic, GABAergic, and serotonergic—contributing to the efficiency and interconnectivity of CNS signaling. This allows for high-efficiency signal propagation across vast brain regions. In PD, CNS dopaminergic neurons degenerate, particularly in the substantia nigra. In MSA, it is the oligodendrocytes themselves that become pathological, forming glial cytoplasmic inclusions of misfolded alpha-synuclein.

One distinguishing feature of MSA is that demyelination occurs across a broad range of neuron types. The death of oligodendrocytes leads to widespread disruption of myelin sheaths, affecting not only dopaminergic neurons but also serotonergic, cholinergic, and other neuron classes. This loss of structural insulation impairs axonal function and triggers apoptotic cell death, contributing to the multisystem nature of degeneration observed in MSA.

By anchoring this anatomical comparison with a clear illustration and accompanying bullet points, we can directly visualize how structural differences in neuron types contribute to both healthy function and disease vulnerability.

## Exosomes

Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles that play a key role in cell-to-cell communication and waste disposal regulation, carrying molecular cargo such as proteins, RNA, and lipids that reflect the state of their parent cells. Research within the last decade has focused on their potential in targeted therapy delivery, disease biomarker discovery, immune system modulation, and strategies to block their uptake to mitigate pathological processes. [Citation Needed]

Regarding neurodegenerative diseases, exosomes are being studied as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis, particularly for disorders like Parkinson’s Disease and Multiple System Atrophy. [Citation Needed] These diseases have long prodromal phases, during which symptoms may be subtle or non-motor in nature, delaying diagnosis until neurodegeneration is already advanced. Since current diagnostic methods rely heavily on clinical evaluations of motor dysfunction, the identification of exosome-based biomarkers could enable earlier, more precise detection. Importantly, clinically viable biomarkers must be detectable in peripheral fluids such as blood or saliva, allowing for non-invasive testing during routine healthcare visits. This could shift the diagnostic paradigm from symptom-based assessments to proactive screening, potentially enabling earlier interventions that slow disease progression. 

Importantly, exosomes can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) bidirectionally, [Citation Needed] allowing for the collection of CNS biomarkers in peripheral fluids and enabling potential therapeutic delivery to the brain. However, in neurodegenerative diseases, a compromised BBB may also permit the entry of exosomes carrying toxic cargo, potentially contributing to disease progression by spreading misfolded proteins, exacerbating neuroinflammation, and inducing metabolic stress. Additionally, exosomes can transport immune-modulating factors, such as cytokines or microRNA, which may further disrupt CNS homeostasis. Understanding these mechanisms is critical, as exosomes could serve as both pathological agents and therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative disease management. [Citation Needed]

One critical advantage of exosome-based diagnostics is their ability to enrich and protect disease-relevant signals, particularly during early, pre-symptomatic stages. While small RNA fragments such as transfer RNA fragments (tRFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) can be measured directly in blood, these signals are often weak and masked by background noise from peripheral tissues. Exosomes overcome this by acting as biological concentrators—secreting stress-induced molecular cargo from diseased cells into protective vesicles that can be selectively captured from biofluids such as blood or saliva. In addition, exosomes display surface antigens reflective of their cell of origin, enabling researchers to isolate vesicles derived from specific cell types, such as dopaminergic neurons or oligodendrocytes. This layered specificity improves signal-to-noise and enhances disease detection, making exosome-based diagnostics a promising platform for the early identification and monitoring of neurodegenerative conditions.

## Key Biomarkers in Neurodegenerative Exosomes

With exosomes established as a viable vehicle for biomarker discovery, the next challenge lies in determining what molecular cargo to interrogate. Ideal biomarkers must not only reflect disease presence, but also offer diagnostic specificity, early-stage sensitivity, and mechanistic insight. In the case of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), several promising categories have emerged—each offering a distinct diagnostic angle. These include small non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and transfer RNA fragments (tRFs), misfolded and post-translationally modified alpha-synuclein, and even the cellular origin of the exosomes themselves, which can be inferred from surface antigens. Together, these biomarkers may allow for early, accurate, and stratified detection of neurodegenerative disease.

## Future Directions and Translational Implications

Despite significant advances in our mechanistic understanding of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), clinical diagnosis remains fundamentally reactive—triggered by overt motor symptoms that arise well after disease onset. Even when PD and MSA are correctly identified, treatment remains largely symptomatic, with little to no impact on long-term progression. Yet early and accurate differentiation still carries meaningful value. For patients and families, it shapes prognosis, expectations, and long-term planning. For clinicians, it informs therapeutic priorities, including the decision to avoid prolonged levodopa trials in likely MSA cases. And for researchers, it allows cleaner stratification in clinical trials and accelerates the development of disease-specific interventions.

Looking ahead, early diagnostic clarity may also enable cross-disease therapeutic repurposing. Although MSA is rare and underrepresented in drug development pipelines, it shares key downstream pathologies with more common disorders. One such overlap is with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), where demyelination—though driven by autoimmune mechanisms—results in similar oligodendrocyte dysfunction and axonal compromise. If emerging MS therapies aimed at remyelination or glial support prove safe and broadly effective, they may offer therapeutic potential for MSA as well, particularly when initiated during its early, preclinical phase.

This principle echoes the trajectory of CAR-T cell therapy, which was first developed and approved for common hematologic malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma before being adapted to treat multiple myeloma. Although the diseases differ in etiology, they share enough downstream immunological architecture to allow therapeutic crossover. The same logic may apply in neurology: therapies developed for more prevalent demyelinating diseases like MS may hold untapped potential in rare disorders such as MSA—and early diagnosis of MSA may enable timely exploration.
