## Introduction
The history of Parkinsonism traces back to 1817 when James Parkinson published An Essay on the Shaking Palsy, describing the characteristic motor symptoms of what would later be called Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Nearly a century later, Jean-Martin Charcot refined Parkinson’s observations, distinguishing the disorder from other movement disorders and formally naming it Maladie de Parkinson. Charcot also identified degeneration of the substantia nigra as a pathological feature, an insight that would later prove essential. Around the same time, in 1900, Dejerine and Thomas described a separate disorder, now known as Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), highlighting its distinct pathology affecting both motor and autonomic functions. In 1912, Friedrich Lewy discovered intraneuronal inclusions—Lewy bodies—marking the first pathological hallmark of PD, though their role remained unclear for decades.

The mid-20th century saw a breakthrough when Arvid Carlsson identified dopamine as a critical neurotransmitter, demonstrating its depletion in PD patients. This discovery paved the way for dopamine-replacement therapy, culminating in the FDA approval of Carbidopa/Levodopa in 1975, which remains the cornerstone of PD treatment. In the 1980s, a turning point emerged when drug users exposed to MPTP developed severe Parkinsonism, revealing the vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons to environmental toxins. This event shifted research away from symptomatic treatments toward mechanistic studies, leading to the discovery that mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and impaired protein degradation contribute to PD pathology. The 1990s solidified alpha-synuclein as a key player, with genetic mutations in SNCA linking the protein to familial PD and misfolded aggregates being identified as a major pathological feature.

Building on this, Heiko Braak proposed in 2003 that PD may originate outside the brain, with misfolded alpha-synuclein spreading from the gut or olfactory system before affecting the CNS. More recently, Filip Scheperjans and others expanded this hypothesis, implicating gut microbiota in triggering the chronic inflammation that might drive early PD pathology. These findings have reframed Parkinson’s research, shifting focus from late-stage neurodegeneration to early detection and intervention.

## Exosomes

Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles that play a key role in cell-to-cell communication and waste removal by transporting molecular cargo such as proteins, RNA, and lipids. Research within the last decade has focused on their potential in targeted therapy delivery, disease biomarker discovery, immune system modulation, and strategies to block their uptake to mitigate pathological processes. [Citation Needed]

Regarding neurodegenerative diseases, exosomes are being studied as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis, particularly for disorders like Parkinson’s Disease and Multiple System Atrophy. [Citation Needed] These diseases have long prodromal phases, during which symptoms may be subtle or non-motor in nature, delaying diagnosis until neurodegeneration is already advanced. Since current diagnostic methods rely heavily on clinical evaluations of motor dysfunction, the identification of exosome-based biomarkers could enable earlier, more precise detection. Importantly, clinically viable biomarkers must be detectable in peripheral fluids such as blood or saliva, allowing for non-invasive testing during routine healthcare visits. This could shift the diagnostic paradigm from symptom-based assessments to proactive screening, potentially enabling earlier interventions that slow disease progression. 

Importantly, exosomes can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) bidirectionally, [Citation Needed] allowing for the collection of CNS biomarkers in peripheral fluids and enabling potential therapeutic delivery to the brain. However, in neurodegenerative diseases, a compromised BBB may also permit the entry of exosomes carrying toxic cargo, potentially contributing to disease progression by spreading misfolded proteins, exacerbating neuroinflammation, and inducing metabolic stress. Additionally, exosomes can transport immune-modulating factors, such as cytokines or microRNA, which may further disrupt CNS homeostasis. Understanding these mechanisms is critical, as exosomes could serve as both pathological agents and therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative disease management. [Citation Needed]

Beyond their role in disease progression, exosomes also serve as natural concentrators of key biomarkers, which might otherwise be too dilute in peripheral fluids like blood or saliva for reliable detection. Furthermore, exosomes carry surface antigens reflective of their parent cells, allowing for selective isolation of disease-relevant exosomes. [Citation Needed] By isolating exosomes derived from specific cell types, such as dopaminergic neurons or oligodendrocytes, researchers can obtain enriched biomarker profiles in measurable concentrations, enhancing disease detection. This makes exosome-based diagnostics a promising avenue for the early identification and monitoring of neurodegenerative conditions.
