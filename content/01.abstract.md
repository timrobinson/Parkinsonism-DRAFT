Parkinsonism is a category of neurological diseases characterized primarily by motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor. Specific diseases include Parkinson’s Disease (PD), Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). While these disorders share overlapping clinical features, their underlying pathologies are complex and heterogeneous. Common pathological features among many forms of idiopathic parkinsonism include misfolded proteins leading to toxic intracellular aggregates, dysfunctional mitochondria resulting in impaired energy production and oxidative stress, chronic central nervous system (CNS) inflammation, and impaired cellular machinery that normally maintains protein homeostasis. The diseases diverge based on the specific cell types affected, the protein that aggregates (e.g., alpha-synuclein in PD, LBD, and MSA; tau in PSP), and the regions of the brain impacted. These pathological changes are reflected in the cargo of exosomes—small extracellular vesicles released by affected cells—which may contain misfolded proteins, markers of mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammatory mediators, and molecular indicators of impaired cellular maintenance. Because exosomes can cross the blood-brain barrier and enter peripheral fluids, they represent a promising avenue for non-invasive biomarker discovery, potentially enabling earlier diagnosis and improved monitoring of disease progression in parkinsonian disorders.
